# Bloginator - Software Development Blogging Project

This project is a blog website that allows users to post stories on a global
feed. Anyone can register to post and comment on other people's posts.


Basic Design:
* Homepage: Allows Existing Users to sign in, or links to sign up page for new users - Checks for users in User Database
* Sign Up Page: Allows new users to sign up, or links back to homepage - Adds new users to User Database
* Dashboard: Shows Posts taken from the Post Database, will lead Delete/Edit/ Add pages, will give option for user to Log Out back to homepage
* Choose what to Delete/Edit Page: May or may not be seperate from the Dashboard, will have some way to checkoff posts you want to either delete or edit - Edits Post Database as needed
* Add Post Page: In essence a form page that will take input for what user wants to post - Adds to Post Database
* Edit Post Page: Like the Add Post Page, but already has post in the form and allows user to modify post as desired - Changes Post in Post Database
